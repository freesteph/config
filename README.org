* Dotfiles

These dotfiles are best-managed with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow][GNU Stow]]. I restore/update them
using this pattern:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
stow -v -t $HOME -D package -S package
#+END_SRC

This effectively removes any previous symlinks I might have in =$HOME=, then
installs the newest package folder into it.
